<h1>Our story</h1>

<p>We here at Bikeable believe that everyone should be able to experience the joy of riding a bycicle.
    That idea actually was the main reason why our founding fathers, twins Tim and Tom Trappers, started the company in 1911.</p>

<p>In the roaring 20's, Tom's eldest son Harley started organising our yearly bycicle races.</p>

<p>By the late 30's both Tim and Tom's sons joined the company. From left to right: Tim, Marcus, Lucas, Tom, Elias, Tobias and Mattias.</p>

<p>Because of covid19, unfortunately this year we had to change our yearly bycicle race into a teambuilding day, but next year it will bigger and more fun than ever, so don't miss it!</p>
